# bitexpert/captainhook-validateauthor

This package provides an action for [Captain Hook](https://github.com/CaptainHookPhp/captainhook) which will reject a commit when author name or email does not match a regex defined in the `captainhook.json` configuration file. Use this action if you want to make sure that your private email address does not end up in your companies' git repositories.
